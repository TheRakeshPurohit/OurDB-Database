# Oikos database

[<img src="img/logo.png" align="right" width="100">](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya/OurDB-Database)

[Oikos](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya/OurDB-Database) is created and licensed with MIT by [Zeel Sheladiya](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya), [Mihir Surati](https://github.com/mihirsurati), [Parth Dabheliya](https://github.com/Parth-Dab) and contributors. 

## What does "Oikos" mean?

> According to philosopher Roger Scruton: "Human beings, in their settled condition, are animated by oikophilia: the love of the oikos, which means not only the home but the people contained in it, and the surrounding settlements that endow that home with lasting contours and an enduring smile.4 The oikos is the place that is not just mine and yours but ours. It is the stage-set for the first-person plural of politics, the locus, both real and imagined, where ‘it all takes place’.
> 
> Virtues like thrift and self-sacrifice, the habit of offering and receiving respect, the sense of responsibility – all those aspects of the human condition that shape us as stewards and guardians of our common inheritance – arise through our growth as persons, by creating islands of value in the sea of price.
>
> To acquire these virtues we must circumscribe the ‘instrumental reasoning’ that governs the life of Homo oeconomicus. We must vest our love and desire in things to which we assign an intrinsic, rather than an instrumental, value, so that the pursuit of means can come to rest, for us, in a place of ends. That is what we mean by settlement: putting the oikos back in the oikonomia. And that is what conservatism is about."

## Features
This database is very portable, user friendly and also in this database you can make your own syntax to execute the queries. there are lot's of feature there that you can use in this database. However, the main feature is that you can connect this database with this:
- Light weight (size less than 2mb)
- scalable
- Can run cross platform (Windows ,Mac ,Linux)
- Dynamically made database. Any developer can easily made changes
- Files with own encryption and own extension .Ourdb
- Even low end device like Arduino , raspberry pi can also run it.
- It requires minimum c++ 17 standard compiler or above to run on any system
- It is combination (NoSQL + SQL) because it doesn’t have schema for storing table but it has perfect syntax for creating query like SQL
