## Features
- Light weight (size less than 2mb)
- scalable
- Can run cross platform (Windows ,Mac ,Linux)
- Dynamically made database. Any developer can easily made changes
- Files with own encryption and own extension .Ourdb
- Even low end device like Arduino , raspberry pi can also run it.
- It requires minimum c++ 17 standard compiler or above to run on any system
- It is combination (NoSQL + SQL) because it doesnâ€™t have schema for storing table but it has perfect syntax for creating query like SQL

## Scope Of The Project
Database Management systems are widely used by companies and organizations to maintain and manage their knowledge and information resources. After completing a database management course, students might work in any number of industries including: Automotive, Banking, Education, Legal, Insurance, Government, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Data Science, NGO etc.
