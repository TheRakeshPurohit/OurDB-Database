# Oikos database

[<img src="img/logo.png" align="right" width="100">](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya/OurDB-Database) 

[Oikos](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya/OurDB-Database) is created and licensed with MIT by [Zeel Sheladiya](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya), [Mihir Surati](https://github.com/mihirsurati), [Parth Dabheliya](https://github.com/Parth-Dab), Pranav Patel and contributors. 

## What does "Oikos" mean?

According to philosopher Roger Scruton: 
>  "Human beings, in their settled condition, are animated by oikophilia: the love of the oikos, which means not only the home but the people contained in it, and the surrounding settlements that endow that home with lasting contours and an enduring smile.
>
> The oikos is the place that is not just mine and yours but ours. It is the stage-set for the first-person plural of politics, the locus, both real and imagined, where ‘it all takes place’.
> 
> Virtues like thrift and self-sacrifice, the habit of offering and receiving respect, the sense of responsibility – all those aspects of the human condition that shape us as stewards and guardians of our common inheritance – arise through our growth as persons, by creating islands of value in the sea of price.
>
> To acquire these virtues we must circumscribe the ‘instrumental reasoning’ that governs the life of Homo oeconomicus. We must vest our love and desire in things to which we assign an intrinsic, rather than an instrumental, value, so that the pursuit of means can come to rest, for us, in a place of ends. That is what we mean by settlement: putting the oikos back in the oikonomia. And that is what conservatism is about."

## Why is the database name Oikos?

There are different types of databases, each database has a different purpose and different use cases or application. The definition of oikos is close to "database" we are developing, creating and maintaining. Because the idea of ​​creating a database is a philosophical idea: In a way we have to "keep" certain data for some time and we worry about how to keep it. These philosophical concerns are close to the "Oikos" concept of Roger Scruton.

Commercially speaking, when we think about making something that people will use, and that in a way there is some concern on the part of developers, users or companies. In a way, we are involved for many philosophical, financial or intellectual reasons. Such a concept on the part is the idea of "Oikos", which is the idea of individual and social responsibility. The idea of having an individualistic social responsibility has always been the basis of the open source movement. The idea that people are driven by common interests linked to certain values or social ties. This creates conditions to help people around us with the problems we are willing to help, contribute, improve or change.

Also, an open source project should have an easy to speak name. The idea of this name is "easy" for different types of language. Because each language would just associate the term oikos with its more specific, targeted, correct term. oikos is the same as "home", "individualistic social responsibility", "open source", "database" or "someone who cares about people and the community". Or you could translate this as "love of neighbor", "mutual respect", "volunteer work"

## How can I contact them for any queries?
If you need any help regarding this project feel free to contact us on our [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/zeel-sheladiya-772513176), [GitHub](https://github.com/zeelsheladiya) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e2Mfs0TdUI) account.

## Features
This database is very portable, user friendly and also in this database you can make your own syntax to execute the queries. there are lot's of feature there that you can use in this database. However, the main feature is that you can connect this database with this:
- Light weight (size less than 2mb)
- scalable
- Can run cross platform (Windows ,Mac ,Linux)
- Dynamically made database. Any developer can easily made changes
- Files with own encryption and own extension .Ourdb
- Even low end device like Arduino , raspberry pi can also run it.
- It requires minimum c++ 17 standard compiler or above to run on any system
- It is combination (NoSQL + SQL) because it doesn’t have schema for storing table but it has perfect syntax for creating query like SQL

# Scope Of The Project
Database Management systems are widely used by companies and organizations to maintain and manage their knowledge and information resources. After completing a database management course, students might work in any number of industries including: Automotive, Banking, Education, Legal, Insurance, Government, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Data Science, NGO etc.

## Overview Of The Existing Systems And Technologies

### Types of Database Management Systems
There are several types of database management systems. Here is a list of seven  common database management systems: Hierarchical databases, Network databases, Relational databases, Object-oriented databases, Graph databases, ER model databases, Document databases, NoSQL databases etc.

### Database Management Software
There are several types of database management softwares. Here is a list of seven common database management softwares: SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, DbVisualizer, ManageEngine Application Manager, Altibase, Oracle RDBMS, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP Sybase ASE, Teradata, ADABAS, MySQL, FileMaker, Microsoft Access, Informix, SQLite, PostgresSQL, AmazonRDS, MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j, OrientDB, Couchbase, phpMyAdmin, SQL Developer, MariaDB etc.
